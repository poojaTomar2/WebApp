###

1. Data

    Per the Windows Azure Getting Started with Data guide, web applications can connect with
    Windows Azure Mobile Services APIs to perform create, read, update and delete (CRUD)
    operations on data service tables. Sample Application demonstrates client side query /
    filtering / paging. The APIs should include standard Table storage as well as custom
    user-defined APIs.

    Ext.Azure will deliver a customized Sencha Touch proxy for the Windows Azure CRUD operations
    to streamline the cross-domain requests (CORS) for data. In addition to the library code,
    Sencha will deliver full documentation, a user guide and at least one working example.

    Known issues with "Developer Preview" available during SenchaCon:
        - Custom APIs support was a late add and not included in this preview.


2. Authentication

Per the Windows Azure Getting Started with Authentication guide, web applications can
authenticate users via Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Twitter oAuth protocols.

Ext.Azure will deliver built-in functionality for user authentication via browser popup on the web.
In addition to the library code, Sencha will deliver full documentation, a user guide and at
least one working example.

Known issues with "Developer Preview" available during SenchaCon:
    - Webview only. Packaged apps have an issue with the pop-up in the workflow.
      Microsoft and Sencha will incorporate a workaround / fix in a later release.


3. Push Notifications

    Per the Windows Azure Getting Started with Push guide, push notifications are limited to
    hybrid (i.e. natively packaged) mobile applications and are not available inside a
    traditional browser. Push notifications can be individually configured through Apple,
    Google, and Microsoftâ€™s developer portals.

    Ext.Azure will deliver wrappers to normalize the behavior of push notifications, using
    the Cordova PushPlugin plugin. In addition to the library code, Sencha will deliver
    full documentation, a user guide and at least one working example for each platform
    (iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8).

    Known issues with "Developer Preview" available during SenchaCon:
        - Sample app work only after the developer obtains keys from the various platforms (onerous process).
          We requested sample or developer keys from Microsoft that will allow the apps to work out-of-the-box.

        - Windows Azure Mobile Services not supporting Blackberry yet.
