Adding Filters to Mobile Services Data
====
This guide explains how to add filtering functionality to your data service proxy. If you have not already done so,
it is advised that you are familiar with configuring Azure data services within your Sencha application.
More information about this is available in the [Getting Started with Data in Azure Mobile Services](#!/guide/mobile_services_data) guide.

You may also refer to the [Basic TODO List with Filters example](#!/example/Filters).

Preamble
----
When used with a list, dataview or grid, the records in a Sencha store are displayed pretty much in the same order
in which they were added. This may be fine for most applications, but there may be times you wish to change the order
in which records are displayed (sorting), or show only a subset of the records in the table (filtering).

Luckily, Sencha allows you to filter and/or sort the records in a store. It can apply these filtering and sorting
rules one of two ways - locally or remotely.

By default, filtering or sorting is done locally at the store level, in that it applies the filters and sorting *only* on the
records that currently exist in the store. For smaller data sets, this is actually very advantageous and can be quite quick.

However, if your remote data source has hundreds, thousands or even more records, it becomes very impractical to read
in the entire table and sort it on the client. This is where the use of remote filtering and sorting comes into play.

Remote filtering and sorting tells the store that it will not attempt to filter or sort the records in the store, but
instead, send the filter and sort parameters to the remote data service with every request. The Azure service will then
return the appropriate set of records matching the sorting or filtering parameters. The result is that your store will
contain only the records which match your filters and that the records are sorted in the order specified.


Add Filters to your Store
----

Adding filters to a store configured with Ext.azure.Proxy is very easy and can be accomplished in one of two ways.
**NOTE: the following examples pertain to Sencha Touch. Ext JS 5 would be similar, though not identical.**

1. You can choose to filter a store by a single field:

        store.filter('text', /\.com$/);

2. You can choose to filter a store by one or more fields as shown with this example of providing multiple Azure filters together in an array:

        store.filter([
            Ext.create('Ext.azure.Filter', {
                property : "text",
                value    : "'Foo'"
            }),
            Ext.create('Ext.azure.Filter', {
                property      : "complete",
                value         : true,
                operator      :"eq",
                chainOperator :"or"
            })
        ]);


As mentioned in the preamble above, by default, filtering is performed only on the records found in the store.
To trigger filtering on the server side you must configure the store for remote filtering using the **remoteFilter** property as shown below:

    Ext.define('myApp.store.ToDoItems', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Store',

        config: {
            //...
            remoteFilter: true
        }
    });


Add Sorting to your Store
----
Sorting data in a store works the same way you would expect in any Sencha application. You make a call to the store's
**sort** method, providing it with the name of the field to sort, and the direction to sort. This will set the sort
parameters for the store.

    store.sort('text', 'ASC');
    // or...
    store.sort('text', 'DESC');

As mentioned in the preamble above, by default, sorting is performed only on the records found in the store.
To trigger sorting of records on the Azure mobile service table before records are retrieved, you must configure the
store for remote sorting using the **remoteSort** property as shown below:

    Ext.define('myApp.store.ToDoItems', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Store',

        config: {
            //...
            remoteSort: true
        }
    });


Add Paging to your Store
----

Paging is also available for any Azure mobile service table and is utilized in the same manner as any other Sencha store.
By default, paging is enabled and the page size is 20. This means that any request for data will return a maximum of 20
records starting at page 0. The pagesize can be adjusted using the **pageSize** property in the store configuration.


    Ext.define('Basic.store.TodoItems', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Store',

        //...

        config: {
            pageSize: 8
            //...
        }
    });

If you wish to receive all records returned from a search of the Azure mobile service table, you must disable paging in
the store proxy by setting the **enablePagingParams** property to false:

    Ext.define('Basic.store.TodoItems', {
        extend : 'Ext.data.Store',

        //...

        config : {

            //...

            proxy : {
                type               : 'azure',
                tableName          : 'TodoItem',
                enablePagingParams : false
            }
        }

    });
