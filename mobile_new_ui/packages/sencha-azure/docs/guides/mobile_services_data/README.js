This data storage provides you with\nflexible tables with standard column types (eg. string, boolean, integer). Your service may create as many tables as\nyour application may require, each with unlimited storage capabilities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sencha Extensions for Microsoft Azure</strong> easily allows you to connect your Sencha models and stores to these data\nservices by means of a special proxy type, <strong>azure</strong>, defined in the package.</p>\n\n<h2 id='mobile_services_data-section-1'>Creating a Data Table</h2>\n\n<p>To create a data service table for use within your Sencha application log into the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com\">Microsoft Azure</a> portal,\nnavigate to <strong>Mobile Services</strong> and select an existing service. If you do not have any services defined, you must\nfirst do so by clicking the <strong>+New</strong> button in the left hand corner of the portal bottom toolbar.\nHelp is available on the Azure portal to guide you through this process.</p>\n\n<p>Once you click on a mobile service name, you will be presented with that service's dashboard. Select the <strong>Data</strong> menu\nitem to view available tables (the list will be empty if you have no tables defined) and click the <strong>Create</strong> button\non the bottom toolbar.</p>\n\n<p>From here just choose a name for your table. This name will be used in the configuration of your proxy.\nYou do not need to define any fields at this time. Azure is quite flexible and can (and will) automatically create\nfields to match the definition of your model fields within your Sencha application. You will note that along with a\ntable name, you may choose table permission, which can initially be left at the default of 'Anybody with the Application Key'.\nClick <strong>save</strong> to create the table. That's all there is to it.</p>\n\n<p>At this time you can define fields for your table or let Azure create fields for you when any application attempts to\ninsert data into the table.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, please see the Azure <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-html/\">Getting Started with Data</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h2 id='mobile_services_data-section-2'>Configuring the Azure Proxy</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is assumed that you have already downloaded, installed and configured your application with the\n<em>Sencha Extensions for Microsoft Azure</em> package. Please review the <a href=\"/#!/guide/including_azure\">Downloading &amp; Including Azure</a>\nguide for more information on these steps.</p>\n\n<p>Using your Mobile Service data <strong>table name</strong>, you can configure the <strong>azure</strong> proxy to communicate with it,\nallowing it to insert, modify and remove records from within your Sencha application.</p>\n\n<p>You can define the proxy in either a <strong>model</strong> or <strong>store</strong> configuration. Note that if you define the proxy at the\nmodel level, all stores which use that model will automatically retrieve and store its data from the data table\nassociated with the proxy configuration. To use several stores, all of which access different Azure service data tables,\nyet use the same model definition, it would be best to configure the proxy in the store (as shown below)\nrather than at the model level.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Ext.define('myApp.model.TodoItem', {\n    extend : 'Ext.data.Model',\n\n    config : {\n        idProperty : 'id',\n        fields     : [ 'id', 'text', 'completed' ]\n    }\n});\n\nExt.define('myApp.store.TodoItems', {\n    extend : 'Ext.data.Store',\n\n    requires: [\n        'myApp.model.TodoItem',\n        '<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.azure.Proxy\" rel=\"Ext.azure.Proxy\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.azure.Proxy</a>'\n    ],\n\n    config : {\n        model    : 'myApp.model.TodoItem',\n        autoSync : true,\n\n        proxy : {\n            type      : 'azure',\n            tableName : 'TodoItem'\n        }\n    }\n}); \n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id='mobile_services_data-section-3'>Proxies, Stores and Auto Sync </h2>\n\n<p>As with all other proxies within Sencha Touch or Ext JS, the <strong>azure</strong> proxy type responds to the store configuration\n<strong>autoSync</strong>. This configuration allows a store to automatically synchronize data changes with the remote\nAzure Mobile service data table associated with the proxy. This is a nice convenience configuration for the store\nwhich removes the need to manually call the store.sync() method after any store updates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you foresee that your application will be doing many updates to the store, you may wish to decide to not\nuse the autoSync feature as high volume updates could cause issues with application speed. In this case you should\nmanually synchronize your store after a series of store modifications have finished.</p>\n\n<h2 id='mobile_services_data-section-4'>Data Authentication</h2>\n\n<p>Access to your data services can be configured with security in mind. One of the nice features of Azure is that you\ncan define Read, Write, Insert and Delete privileges on any of your data tables.</p>\n\n<p>For more information regarding Authentication and how to secure your table data, please refer to\nthe <a href=\"#!/guide/mobile_services_authentication\">Authentication</a> guide.</p>\n","title":"Data Services"});
