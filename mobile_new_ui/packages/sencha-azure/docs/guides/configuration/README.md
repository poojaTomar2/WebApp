Configuring Azure
====

Once you have successfully downloaded and installed the Azure extension and included it in your application, the final
step is to supply your application with your Azure mobile service access credentials.

Prerequisites
---

Before continuing with this section, you are required to have already setup an Azure mobile service that your application will be using. 

When you create a mobile service in Azure (see [Getting Started with Azure](#!/guide/getting_started)) an application
key and URL will be assigned to that service. This information must be provided to your Azure package so it can
connect to your service.

Sencha Touch vs Ext JS
---

The *Sencha Extensions for Microsoft Azure* were originally developed for Sencha Touch, but are now also compatible
with Ext JS 5.

Because of small differences in the Ext.Appliction() API between Sench Touch an Ext JS, you should be aware of the proper
configuration of Ext.Azure in both frameworks.

In Sencha Touch:

    Ext.application({
        name: 'MyApp',

        requires: [ 'Ext.azure.Azure' ],

        azure: {
            appKey: 'myazureservice-access-key',
            appUrl: 'myazure-service.azure-mobile.net'
        },

        launch: function() {

            // Call Azure initialization

            Ext.Azure.init(this.config.azure);

        }
    });

In Ext JS 5:

    Ext.application({
        name: 'MyApp',

        requires: [ 'Ext.azure.Azure' ],

        // NOTE: WE WRAP azure INSIDE config WHEN USING EXT JS 5
        config : {
            azure: {
                appKey: 'myazureservice-access-key',
                appUrl: 'myazure-service.azure-mobile.net'
            },
        },

        launch: function() {

            // Call Azure initialization

            Ext.Azure.init(this.config.azure);

        }
    });

As we can see, the APIs are nearly identical -- but Ext JS 5 requires an additional layer of nesting our *azure* object
inside the *config* object.

**Most of the examples in the API documentation and guides for this extension will follow the Sencha Touch convention
relating to Ext.Appliction() for simplicity and consistency.** All of the other code samples should be identical between
Sencha Touch and Ext JS 5.

Basic Azure Initialization
---
The Azure package is initialized by calling the **Ext.Azure.init** method in the launch section of your application.
This method is passed a configuration object containing mobile service creditials as well as other creditials and
features you wish to utilize.

While you can pass the configuration object directly to the init method, we suggest creating a Sencha application
configuration property called **azure** and placing all the appropriate information there. You can then pass this
property value to the Ext.Azure.init method.

This example shows a very simple Azure configuration and initialization supplying only the application key and URL.
You would, of course, be providing the actual key and url for your mobile service in place of the example values shows here:

    Ext.application({
        name: 'MyApp',

        requires: [ 'Ext.azure.Azure' ],

        azure: {
            appKey: 'myazureservice-access-key',
            appUrl: 'myazure-service.azure-mobile.net'
        },

        launch: function() {

            // Call Azure initialization

            Ext.Azure.init(this.config.azure);

        }
    });

For more detailed information on the Azure configuration options, please consult the Ext.Azure API documentation.

Configuring the Azure data proxy
----

Providing the application key and URL allows your application to connect to the service. However it does not provide
any information about the service itself and tables within the service that are available to your application.

You provide table information by configuring data proxies in your application models or stores. The proxy only needs
to be set to type **azure** and be provided with a service tablename. The model fields are used to identify the
columns you created in your Azure mobile service table.

In this example, we configure our data model with an Azure proxy and specify a **tableName** of 'ToDoItem'.
The **tableName** config tells the proxy which Azure database table to use.


        Ext.define('MyApp.model.TodoItem', {
            extend : 'Ext.data.Model',

            requires : [
                'Ext.azure.Proxy'
            ],

            config : {
                idProperty : 'id',
                fields     : [
                    {
                        name : 'id',
                        type : 'int'
                    },
                    {
                        name : 'text',
                        type : 'string'
                    },
                    {
                        name : 'complete',
                        type : 'boolean'
                    }
                ],

                proxy : {
                    type        : 'azure',
                    tablename   : 'TodoItem'
                }
            }
        });


The Azure proxy will automatically set all HTTP headers with the appropriate CRUD operations expected by the
Azure API (including authentication credentials, if they exist).

Congratulations! Your application should now have access to your Azure mobile service.
